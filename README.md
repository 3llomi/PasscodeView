# PasscodeView
##### PasscodeView is an Android Library to easily and securely authenticate user with PIN code or using the fingerprint scanner.


## Why‚ùì
- Secure authentication is the key factor in many application (e.g. financial applications). Many application uses PIN based authentication. 
- But Android System doesn't provide any easy to set view for PIN based authentication which can tightly integrate and take advantage of fingerprint API introduced in newer versions of android. This limitation led me to work on this project.

- With use of *PasscodeView* you can easily integrate PIN & Fingerprint based authentication in your application. 


## Features:
This library provide easy and secure PIN authentication view, which
- provides access to built in fingerprint based authentication. This handles all the complexities of imtegrating the fingerprint API with your application.
- provide error feedback when PIN entered is wrong.
- is highly customisable. So that you can match it with your application them. It provides you control over,
  - shape of the each key.
  - color of the key and pin indicators.
  - size of the each single key.
  

## How to integrate?
- Gradle dependency and guide to integrate this library coming soon. Meanwhile you can see sample project if you want.
